This website assembles real-world manifestations of ethical issues in software engineering, in order to:

* document and explain ethical issues in software engineering
* present relationships between past and present ethical issues
* help software engineers form their own ethical positions on issues that they have a direct impact on
* organize software engineers from around the world to create and maintain an up-to-date reference work

This website also collect real-world discussions of ethical issues in software engineering – in the form of excerpts from newspaper/website articles, blog posts, YouTube videos, etc. – in order to provide background for the cases and attempt to show how the actors involved justified their positions.

Although this website's contributors may hold ethical positions of their own, no attempt is made here to explicitly or implicitly attack or defend any particular ethical position or moral norm. If you find that an ethical position or moral norm is underrepresented, overrepresented, or misrepresented, we invite you to add or correct the relevant entries.
